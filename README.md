# HumanitudE AR Training System "HEARTS"

HEARTS is a training system for dementia patients using AR technology and a real object for the gentle and effective caregiving technique "Humanitude".

HEARTS enables interaction between a caregiver and a patient during care training by overlaying the patient's face on a doll using an AR device such as HoloLens 2 or NrealLight.
